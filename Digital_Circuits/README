## ðŸ”¹ Labs Included
1. **Smart Home Logic Controller**
   - Designed a room controller for lighting and blinds with four modes: *Standard, Lunchtime, Nighttime, Emergency*.
   - Implemented logic with **truth tables, Boolean equations, and NAND-only circuits**.
   - Simulated designs using *Digital* software and exported to **VHDL**.
   - Implemented on **FPGA (Vivado)** and tested with switches and LEDs.
   - Measured **propagation delays** using an oscilloscope.

2. **Adder and Counter**
   - Implemented an **8-bit combinational adder** and extended it to a **registered adder** with synchronous reset and enable.
   - Designed an **accumulator** with feedback connections.
   - Implemented **counters** with external and internal feedback.
   - Verified timing and propagation delays using FPGA boards and oscilloscopes.
   - Compared performance between feedback methods.
